                <h2>Quotes</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    No matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in
                    moonlight, strangled by my own bra.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    I don't want my life to imitate art, I want my life to be
                    art.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    I am truly a product of Hollywood in-breeding. When two
                    celebrities mate, someone like me is the result.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    There is no point at which you can say, 'Well, I'm
                    successful now. I might as well take a nap.'
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>I'm very sane about how crazy I am.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    If my life wasn't funny it would just be true, and that is
                    unacceptable.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    Do not let what you think they think of you make you stop
                    and question everything you are.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    I really love the internet. They say chat-rooms are the
                    trailer park of the internet but I find it amazing.
